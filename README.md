# Circuit Breaker module demo

In this repositories you will find two applications and two API specifications. The primary reason is to show you how my custom Circuit Breaker module works. 

## Dependencies

Circuit Breaker module is available [here](https://github.com/dyeeye/mule-circuit-breaker-module). You need to install **consent-process-api**, **consent-mongodb-system-api** either on your personal Anypoint Exchange or locally in the application.

When you decide to use dependancies from Anypoint Exchange remember to alter pom.xml files. I have added comment above the dependency 
```
<!-- Dependency to Consent Process API on Exchange -->
```
